## 🚀 Zero-Downtime Blue-Green Deployment with Terraform

This project demonstrates a Blue-Green Deployment strategy implemented with Terraform to achieve zero downtime application updates on AWS. The setup ensures that new releases are safely deployed, tested, and verified before switching live user traffic — all through Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

By maintaining two identical environments — Blue (live) and Green (staging) — this project enables smooth transitions between versions while minimizing deployment risks.

## 🧩 Project Structure

📁 **VPC/**
Contains Terraform configurations for setting up the foundational AWS infrastructure — including the VPC, subnets, route tables, security groups, and an Application Load Balancer (ALB).
This shared network layer serves both Blue and Green environments to ensure consistent and cost-effective resource management.

📁 **Terraform/**
Defines the core infrastructure for both Blue and Green deployments, including EC2 instances, target groups, and necessary configurations.
Each deployment is isolated but runs in the same network environment for easy switching and rollback.

📁 **Switch_Traffic/**
Contains Terraform files that handle traffic routing between Blue and Green deployments via the Application Load Balancer.
This directory allows traffic to be switched only after the new environment (Green) has been tested and confirmed stable.
