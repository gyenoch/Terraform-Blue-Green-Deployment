## ðŸš€ Zero-Downtime Blue-Green Deployment with Terraform

This project demonstrates a Blue-Green Deployment strategy implemented with Terraform to achieve zero downtime application updates on AWS. The setup ensures that new releases are safely deployed, tested, and verified before switching live user traffic â€” all through Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

By maintaining two identical environments â€” Blue (live) and Green (staging) â€” this project enables smooth transitions between versions while minimizing deployment risks.
